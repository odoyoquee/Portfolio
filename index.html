            <h2>Who am I</h2>
            <p id="ph">My name is Odoyo Grace Awino and I am a software development student currently studying how to
                code at Moringa School.
                I was a student at Chuka University persuing a course in social work before i developed an interest in
                coding.
                I heard about Moringa School which is the best so far in helping me achieve my goal.
                I believe that finally I'll be able to be great at what i do and conquer. I love working together with
                new people in order to
                develop new project ideas that will assist in making life easier.
            </p>

        <span id="floatright">
            <h2>My interests</h2>
            <p id="interests">I am interested in a lot of things but I am currently doing programming which is also
                among my interests.
                Currently,I have only learnt how to use html,css and a little javascript which is quite an interesting
                experience.
                I am looking forward to learning more programming languages and become a great and well known developer
                in order to show
                individuals it's importance and for them to learn to code towards a better future as i strongly believe
                that technology
                has the capability of changing the world.

            <h2 id="bility">Capabilities</h2>
            <p id="caps">I am now capable of being able to structure my website using html and style it using css.I can
                also apply a little
                javascript which is essential for providing user interface.I can atleast come up with various ideas to
                help in handling a project.
                I am looking forward to completing other languages and also learn how to work with them in my website.It
                would be such an amazing
                experience for anyone.
